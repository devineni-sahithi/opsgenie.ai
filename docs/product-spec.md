# OpsGenie.AI Product Spec

## Vision
Deliver an integrated incident co-pilot that accelerates detection, mitigation, and learning across engineering teams.

## Personas
- **Staff SRE** needs consolidated visibility, fast triage, and automation.
- **Engineering Manager** tracks reliability, readiness, and runbook hygiene.
- **Incident Commander** coordinates communication and mitigation.

## Key workflows
1. Review active incidents and pull up the most relevant runbooks and AI recommendations.
2. Inspect the on-call rotation, SLO health, and upcoming maintenance to plan response capacity.
3. Ask the Ops assistant for guidance, status summaries, or communication drafts.
4. Capture new incidents and ensure they automatically populate with timelines and playbooks.

## Success metrics
- Mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to mitigate (MTTM) reduced by 25%.
- On-call engineers self-report higher confidence scores (>4/5).
- Runbook engagement tracked through assistant prompts grows month-over-month.
